* **Gray Hat**: In-between

#### 24. **Patch Management Frequency**

* Critical patches: Immediately
* Others: Within a month

#### 25. **Reset BIOS Password**

* Remove CMOS battery to reset BIOS settings.

#### 26. **MITM Attack & Prevention**

* Intercepts communication.
  **Prevention**: HTTPS, VPN, Public Key Auth, IDS.

#### 27. **DDoS Attack & Prevention**

* Server flooded with traffic.
  **Prevention**: Load balancers, firewalls, rate-limiting, anti-DDoS tools.

#### 28. **XSS Attack & Prevention**

* Injects malicious scripts.
  **Prevention**: Input validation, output encoding, anti-XSS tools.

#### 29. **What is ARP?**

Address Resolution Protocol: Maps IP to MAC address within a local network.

#### 30. **What is Port Blocking in LAN?**

Restricting ports/services to prevent unauthorized access.

#### 31. **Protocols Under TCP/IP Layers**

| Layer       | Protocols                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Application | FTP, HTTP, DNS, SMTP, SNMP |
| Transport   | TCP, UDP                   |
| Internet    | IP, ICMP, ARP              |
